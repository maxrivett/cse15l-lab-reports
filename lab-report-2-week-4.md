# Lab Report 2, Week 4

*In this lab report I will be showcasing three code changes I made to fix bugs in the initial code we were given.*
<br><br>
For each code change, I will...
<br>
* Show a screenshot of the code change diff from Github (a page like this)
* Link to the test file for a failure-inducing input that prompted you to make that change
* Show the symptom of that failure-inducing input by showing the output of running the file at the command line for the version where it was failing (this should also be in the commit message history)
* Write 2-3 sentences describing the relationship between the bug, the symptom, and the failure-inducing input.

1. Here is a screenshot of the code change diff from Github:
![Test 1 Commit](images/labreport2/test1commit.png)
<br>[Test File for Break 1](lab-report-2-files/test-break-1.md)
<br>
Here is an example of the output before I fixed the bug:
![Test 1 Fail](images/labreport2/test1fail.png)
And after I fixed the bug:
![Test 1 Pass](images/labreport2/test1pass.png)

2. Here is a screenshot of the code change diff from Github:
